# CSP-BACKTRACKING-SEARCH-sudokusolver

Represent our sudoku problem as CSP, the three properties of the CSP are defined as follow:

Variables: Each cell (row, column) on the sudoku puzzle.
Domains: For each empty cell, a domain is defined as a set of numbers between 1 and 9.
         For each pre-filled cell, a domain is the existed value.  
Constraints: No redundant numbers in rows, columns and the 3 x 3 regions that the cell is in.

the algorithm is BACKTRACKING-SEARCH from chapter 6 Constraint Satisfaction Problem of the book.
For the methodology of forward-checking in my code, it is not generated by myself, I studied others'program
online, and used its methodology in my problem.
